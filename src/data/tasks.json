                "body": "Strongly lensed supernovae are an excellent method to test cosmic evolution of SNe Ia, controlling systematics in dark energy inference, and understanding their progenitors. With future observations, a large sample of SN spectra can be compared to predictions from different explosion models to infer the progenitor channels of SNe Ia. This will help to distinguish between different model scenarios."

The comparison between the observed spectrum and the spectra of low-z SNe Ia, as well as the composite spectra based on the lightcurve shape.\n4. The evaluation of spectral line velocities of SN Encore and other lensed SNe Ia, which are found to be consistent with the distribution observed for low-z SNe Ia.\n5.
